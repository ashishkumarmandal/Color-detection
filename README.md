# Color Detection Project

This project is designed to detect colors in images using Python. It includes a Jupyter Notebook and a Python script for color detection, as well as several sample images.

## Files Included

- `color_detection.py`: A Python script for detecting colors in images.
- `color_detection_final.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating color detection.
- `colors.csv`: A CSV file containing color names and their RGB values.
- Sample Images: Various images used for testing color detection, including `ai-generated-8713076_1920.png`, `bird-6976834_1920.jpg`, `colorpic.jpg`, `pexels-mastercowley-1192671.jpg`, `pexels-npandey-2446439.jpg`, `pic 2.jpg`, `pic 3.png`, and `sunset-8424565_640.jpg`.

## How to Use

1. **Python Script**: Run `color_detection.py` to detect colors in the specified image.
2. **Jupyter Notebook**: Open `color_detection_final.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to see the step-by-step process of color detection.
